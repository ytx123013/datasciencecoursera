#About the process data
##4 things you should have
*	The raw data
*	A tidy data set
*	A code book describing each variable and its values in tidy data set
*	An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 to 2,3

###The tidy data tips
1. Each variable should be in on column
2. There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
3. If have multiple tables,they should include a column that allows them to be linked
4. Include a row at the top of each file with variable names
5. The variable should be complete and clearly
6. Data should be saved in one file per table

###The cook book tips
1. Information about the variables(including units)in the data set not contained in the tidy data
2. Information about the summary choices you made
3. Information about the experimental study design you used
4. A common format for the document is a Word/text file
5. There should be a section called "Study Design" that has a thorough description of how you collected the data
6. There must be a section called "Code Book" that descirbles each variable and its units.

###The instruction list
you should provide the detail information about how to produce the tidy data,some instruction like blow:

1. take the xxx file,run version xxx of xxx software with parameters ...  
2. the xxx raw data,run the software,produce the xxx data
